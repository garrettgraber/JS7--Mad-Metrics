			<h3>Part 1</h3>

			<p class="text-section">Bjork: Everything is music. When I go home, I throw knickers in the oven and it's music. Crash, boom, bang! (makes indistinct noises) (buzz) 

Alex Trebek: Wow. The answer, of course, was bread. Let's go to "Members of Simon and Garfunkel" for $200. "Of Simon and Garfunkel, the one that is not Garfunkel." [Bjork buzzes in] Bjork? 

Bjork: Sometimes when I'm putting oranges in the sauerkraut, I think of my thoughts and they make me laugh. [buzz] No? 

Alex Trebek: Are you Icelandic or retarded? [Sean Connery buzzes in] Sean Connery? 

Sean Connery: Can you repeat the question?</p>

			<h3>Part 2</h3>

			<p class="text-section">Alex Trebek: "Of Simon and Garfunkel, the one that is not Garfunkel". 

Sean Connery: I Garfunkeled your mother. [starts laughing] 

Alex Trebek: Come on. [Dave Matthews buzzes in] Dave Matthews? 

[Boyd Tinsley enters and plays the intro to the Dave Matthews Band's "Ants Marching".] 

Dave Matthews: [singing] "He wakes up in the morning, does his teeth, bite to eat, and he's rolling..." [buzz] 

Alex Trebek: Wrong.</p>

Dave Matthews: I'm sorry, what is - 

[Boyd Tinsley resumes playing "Ants Marching"] 

Dave Matthews: [singing] "He wakes up in the morning..." [buzz] 

[Bjork buzzes in] 

Alex Trebek: Bjork? 

Bjork: This buzzer is musical. Everything is musical. [starts playing with the buzzers and makes indistinct noises]

			<h3>Part 4</h3>

			<p class="text-section">Sean Connery: I'll take "I Have a Hard-on" for $600. 

[close-up to board, the category "I Have a Chardonnay" is edited to read "I Have a Hardon".] 

Alex Trebek: I don't believe this. Where did you get that magic marker? We frisked you in on the way in here. 

Sean Connery: I didn't have it in my pocket. 

Alex Trebek: That's disgusting. Please. 

Sean Connery: I bet if you frisked me, you would have found it. 

Alex Trebek: All right, that's enough. 

Sean Connery: Because I was keeping it in my butt. 

Alex Trebek: Okay. We get it. Loud and clear: we get it. It's time for Final Jeopardy... 

[The real Alex Trebek enters.] 

Real Alex Trebek: And so this was Final Jeopardy. And what a ride it has been, from Burt Reynolds to Minnie Driver, but boy, oh boy, those celebrities did not know the right answers to any of your questions. 

Alex Trebek: No, they did not. They were very stupid. 

Real Alex Trebek: You got that right.</p>
